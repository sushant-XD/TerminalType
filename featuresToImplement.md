## Features to Implement (ranked with decreasing level of priority)

- WPM calculation and accuracy calculation is logically flawed, need to see what's going on
- Words are stored in .txt files and hardcoded. Global install doesn't work. Need to fix it.
- past 20 or so data store with sqlite, show history, highest ever wpm, weak words, characters, etc. to the user
- right now, if a character is wrong, all the next sequence of characters are marked as wrong. User should be able to change this and make it like normal typing games like monkeytype and 10ff
- change the UI just a little bit and easier to navigate
- Create a config file to change UI and default settings easily
